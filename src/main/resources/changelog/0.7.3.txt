Bug Fixes:

* [#46] "block.libmultipart.container" showing instead of a more reasonable block name.
* [#47] Fixed some AbstractPart methods not being marked as client-side-only.
* Made MultipartBlockEntity and PartContainer register their LNS network IDs early, so we can debug
  bugs where LMP network data is sent before the block entity itself is sent.
