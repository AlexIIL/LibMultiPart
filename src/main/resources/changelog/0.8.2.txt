Changes:

* Fixes bug where placing multiparts was never updating neighbor blocks in some ways.
* Fixes bug where client-side multipart block transformations could cause a crash on world-load.
* Adds a compat module.
    * Currently, this module adds compatibility code for the WTHIT tooltip mod, allowing parts to properly display their
      names in tooltips.
